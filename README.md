# ARC Tracker

A self-hosted web tool for tracking blueprints and ARC parts across multiple characters in [ARC Raiders](https://arcraiders.com/).

## Features

### Blueprint Tracking
- **83 blueprints** seeded from [arcraiders.wiki](https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Blueprints) across 7 categories: Weapons, Mods, Explosives, Medicine, Augments, Utility, and Crafting
- **Per-character tracking** — mark each blueprint as Learned/Consumed and track extra copies with +/– controls or direct input
- **Quick learn/unlearn all** — bulk-toggle all visible blueprints for a character in one click
- **Blueprint icons** — downloaded from arcraiders.wiki on first startup using an explicit name→file mapping; SVG category-icon placeholders generated for any not found
- **Alphabetical ordering** — all blueprint lists are sorted A→Z regardless of category filter

### ARC Parts Tracking *(new in v1.1.0)*
- **9 Epic & Legendary ARC parts** seeded from [arcraiders.wiki](https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC): Queen Reactor, Matriarch Reactor, Bastion Cell, Bombardier Cell, Leaper Pulse Unit, Rocketeer Driver, Vaporizer Regulator, Turbine Compressor, and Assessor Matrix
- **Per-character count tracking** — increment or decrement how many of each part a character holds, with click-to-edit direct input
- **In-game icons** — all 9 part icons downloaded from arcraiders.wiki; rarity-colored fallbacks (amber for Legendary, purple for Epic)
- **Grouped display** — Legendary parts shown above Epic parts with distinct color coding

### Characters
- **Multi-character support** — add as many characters as you need
- **Multi-select labels** — assign one or more labels per character from presets (Wipe, Non-Wipe, Mule, PvP, PvE, HC, Leveling, Trade) or create custom labels
- **Color coding** — pick from preset colors or a custom color picker; colors appear throughout the UI
- **Notes** — optional free-text notes per character
- **Nomad Stash** — per-character +/– counter for tracking your stash count, starting at zero
- **At-a-glance stats** — each character card shows learned blueprint count, unlearned count, spare/extra copies, and total ARC parts collected
- **Delete confirmation** — a prominent confirmation prompt (with warning) is shown before a character and all its data are permanently removed

### Blueprints Page
- **Filter by category** — Weapons, Mods, Explosives, Medicine, Augments, Utility, Crafting, or All
- **Filter by status** — All, Learned, or Not Learned
- **Full-text search** — filter blueprints by name in real time
- **Character switcher** — switch between characters without leaving the page

### ARC Parts Page *(new in v1.1.0)*
- **Filter by rarity** — All, Legendary, or Epic
- **Full-text search** — filter by part name or source enemy
- **Character switcher** — per-character counts, switching without leaving the page
- **Grouped sections** — Legendary parts at the top, Epic parts below

### Reports
- **Unlearned Blueprints** — collapsible rows showing which blueprints are missing for at least one character; expand any row to see each character's ✓/✗ status with name and labels
- **Extras Inventory** — total extras per blueprint sorted by count; expand to drill down into which characters hold extras and how many
- **ARC Parts Inventory** *(new in v1.1.0)* — total ARC parts collected per part type; expand to see per-character counts with rarity badges and source enemy info; sorted Legendary-first

### UI & Themes
- **Dark, Light, and System/Auto** color schemes — toggle between dark (default), light, or follow the OS preference; choice persisted in `localStorage`
- **Responsive layout** — sidebar navigation with the official ARC Raiders icon
- **Modern design** — built with Tailwind CSS, smooth transitions, and consistent arc-themed color tokens

## Quick Start

### Docker — pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry (easiest)

```bash
# Pull and run the latest image (no build required)
docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

Pin to a specific release:

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=v1.1.1 docker compose -f docker-compose.ghcr.yml up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:3001>

### Docker — build locally from source

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Override the host port

```bash
HOST_PORT=8080 docker compose up -d
```

### Development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (starts on :3001)
cd backend && npm install && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 — frontend (proxies /api → :3001, starts on :5173)
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

### Re-download icons

```bash
# Trigger a re-download from a running container via the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/icons/refresh

# Or exec into the container directly
docker compose exec arc-tracker node /app/scripts/download-icons.js --force

# Or run locally (downloads to ./data/icons/)
DATA_DIR=./data node scripts/download-icons.js
```

## Security

- **Helmet.js** — CSP, X-Frame-Options, and other HTTP security headers (HSTS intentionally disabled; handled by the reverse proxy)
- **Rate limiting** — 300 req/min reads, 120 req/min writes per IP via `express-rate-limit`
- **Parameterized SQL** — no SQL injection risk (`better-sqlite3` prepared statements)
- **Non-root container user** — runs as `arcapp` (uid 1001)
- **Read-only root filesystem** — only `/data` and `/tmp` are writable at runtime
- **All capabilities dropped** — `cap_drop: ALL` in Docker Compose
- **No built-in authentication** — designed to sit behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy, Traefik) that handles auth

## CI/CD

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`) automatically builds and publishes multi-platform images to GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main`.

| Event | What happens |
|-------|-------------|
| Push to `main` | Build for `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64` on native runners, push `latest` + `sha-<short>` tags |
| Push a `v*.*.*` tag | Also publish semver tags (`1.2.3`, `1.2`, `1`) |
| Pull request | Build only (no push) to validate the Dockerfile |

Builds use native ARM64 runners (no QEMU emulation) and GitHub Actions layer caching for fast rebuilds.

The image is published at:

```
ghcr.io/pyrodex/arc-tracker
```

## Reverse Proxy Example (Caddy)

```caddy
arc.yourdomain.com {
    basicauth * {
        youruser JDJhJDE0...
    }
    reverse_proxy localhost:3001
}
```
